# Service workers

A little playground to get the hang of service workers. So far, based solely on one intro video

## Step-by-step

1. Check in main.js file if SWs are available, if yes, register the sw.js file
2. Start caching
   1. Cache specific assets, see `sw_cached_pages.js`
   2. Cache the site as user browses `sw_cached_site.js`

## TBD

* [ ] Check the docs
* [ ] Timeouts?
* [ ] Strategies
